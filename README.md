## Key Distinction

**TreeAI** was the foundational forestry intelligence platform that established core business logic and pricing optimization systems.

**TreeShop Ops** represents the next evolution - a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system that builds upon TreeAI's foundation while adding:
- Advanced swarm intelligence patterns
- Real-time cross-domain coordination
- Democratic consensus protocols
- Continuous learning across the entire ecosystem

All new development and documentation should reference **TreeShop Ops** as the current platform.
