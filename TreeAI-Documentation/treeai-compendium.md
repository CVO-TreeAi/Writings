## 

Part III: TreeAi Logic Registry System

### ---

3.1 Core Formulas Registry

#### 

Formula ID: TS-001 \- Base TreeScore Calculation

**File Path:** /compendium/logic/formulas.md\#ts-001

`BTS = H × CD × (DBH_in ÷ 12)`

**Inputs:**

* H \- Tree height in feet (measured or estimated)  
* CD \- Canopy diameter in feet (CR × 2\)  
* DBH\_in \- Diameter at breast height in inches

**Business Logic:** Quantifies tree complexity by combining three-dimensional mass. Larger, taller trees with bigger trunks score higher, indicating more complex removal operations.

**Example:** 25ft tall oak, 14ft canopy radius (28ft diameter), 18in DBH  
BTS \= 25 × 28 × (18 ÷ 12\) \= 25 × 28 × 1.5 \= 1,050

#### 

Formula ID: HI-001 \- Hazard Impact Calculator

**File Path:** /compendium/logic/formulas.md\#hi-001

`HI = Σ(Hazard Percentages from HISS)`

**HISS \- Hazard Identification Scoring System:**

* Pool: \+15% | Fence: \+10% | Structures: \+20%  
* Utilities: \+25% | Permitting: \+30%  
* Steep Terrain: \+12% | Soft Soil: \+8%  
* Limited Access: \+18% | Nearby Vehicles: \+14%  
* Glass Windows: \+9% | Septic Tank: \+7%  
* Overhead Lines: \+22% | Underground Utilities: \+19%

**Example:** Tree near house (+20%) with overhead power lines (+22%) on steep slope (+12%)

HI \= 20% \+ 22% \+ 12% \= 54%

#### 

Formula ID: FTS-001 \- Final TreeScore

**File Path:** /compendium/logic/formulas.md\#fts-001

`FTS = BTS × (1 + HI_decimal)`

**Integration:** Combines base complexity (TS-001) with hazard multipliers (HI-001)

**Example:** BTS \= 1,050, HI \= 54%  
FTS \= 1,050 × (1 \+ 0.54) \= 1,050 × 1.54 \= 1,617

#### 

Formula ID: TC-002 \- Total Cost Calculator

**File Path:** /compendium/logic/formulas.md\#tc-002

`TC = (Setup_Cost + (FTS × Rate_Per_Point)) × Profit_Multiplier`

**Components:**

* Setup\_Cost \- Base cost for crew mobilization  
* FTS \- Final TreeScore from FTS-001  
* Rate\_Per\_Point \- Dollar value per TreeScore point  
* Profit\_Multiplier \- Business markup (typically 1.4-1.8)

**Example:** $200 setup, FTS=1,617, $0.75/point, 1.5x markup

TC \= (200 \+ (1,617 × 0.75)) × 1.5 \= (200 \+ 1,212.75) × 1.5 \= $2,119
