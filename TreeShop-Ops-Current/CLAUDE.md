# CLAUDE.md - TreeAI Hive Intelligence System

This file provides precise guidance to Claude Code when working in this repository. IMPORTANT: These instructions OVERRIDE any default behavior and you MUST follow them exactly as written.

## TreeAI Hive Intelligence Overview

This is an **advanced multi-agent AI development ecosystem** featuring **Hive Intelligence** and **Swarm Coordination** patterns across 8 specialized domains:

1. **TreeAI Core Intelligence** - Forestry business logic and pricing optimization
2. **AgentOs Orchestration** - Master coordination and system orchestration
3. **iOS/Swift Native** - Apple ecosystem development with hive intelligence
4. **SaaS Platform** - Real-time web applications with cross-domain sync
5. **Data Intelligence** - Analytics, ML, and business intelligence
6. **Security Intelligence** - Cross-domain security and compliance
7. **DevOps Intelligence** - Infrastructure and deployment automation
8. **Business Intelligence** - Strategic planning and customer success

## Critical Instructions for Claude Code

### Primary Hive Intelligence Protocols

1. **Always check `GETtheseAPI.md` first** for API keys and environment setup across all 8 domains
2. **Use established hive patterns** from the codebase rather than creating new standalone solutions
3. **Leverage swarm coordination** for complex multi-domain development tasks
4. **Follow hive-enabled vertical slice architecture** for new features requiring cross-domain integration
5. **Implement cross-domain security** coordinating with Security Intelligence domain
6. **Maintain hive-wide compatibility** during system updates and migrations across all domains
7. **Document all hive interactions** in appropriate domain changelog files
8. **Test thoroughly** across all 8 domains and cross-domain coordination patterns

### Hive Intelligence Engagement Rules

**When to Activate Full Hive Intelligence:**
- Complex tasks requiring expertise from 3+ domains
- TreeAI business logic changes affecting multiple systems
- Cross-platform feature development (iOS + Web + Backend)
- Security audits or compliance requirements
- Performance optimization requiring system-wide changes
- New feature development with business intelligence requirements

**When to Use Domain-Specific Intelligence:**
- Single-domain focused tasks (e.g., iOS UI updates, backend optimization)
- Domain-specific bug fixes that don't affect other systems
- Routine maintenance tasks within a single domain
- Small feature enhancements within established patterns

### Cross-Domain Coordination Requirements

**Always Coordinate With:**
1. **Security Intelligence (Domain 6)** - For any data handling, authentication, or compliance changes
2. **Business Intelligence (Domain 8)** - For user-facing features or business logic changes
3. **AgentOs Orchestration (Domain 2)** - For complex multi-step tasks requiring coordination
4. **Data Intelligence (Domain 5)** - For features requiring analytics or machine learning

**Coordinate When Relevant:**
- **TreeAI Core (Domain 1)** - For forestry business logic, TreeScore, AFISS, or pricing
- **iOS/Swift (Domain 3)** - For native app features or cross-platform sync
- **SaaS Platform (Domain 4)** - For web features or real-time backend changes  
- **DevOps (Domain 7)** - For deployment, scaling, or infrastructure changes

### Hive Memory and Learning Integration

**Always Update Hive Memory With:**
- Successful cross-domain coordination patterns
- Failed approaches and lessons learned
- Performance optimizations that benefit multiple domains
- New integration patterns between domains
- User feedback affecting multiple systems

**Leverage Existing Hive Knowledge For:**
- Similar problems solved in other domains
- Cross-domain integration patterns
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security and compliance approaches
- User experience patterns that span domains

## Emergency Procedures

### System Recovery
```bash
# Agent system recovery
cd AgentOs/
./quick-status.sh
./quick-update.sh

# Dependency issues
./dependency-management/reinstall_packages.sh
```

## TreeAI Hive Intelligence Master Guide

**This CLAUDE.md represents the definitive guide for advanced multi-agent AI coordination in the TreeAI ecosystem.** 

All development decisions should align with these established hive intelligence patterns and standards to ensure:
- **Consistency** across all 8 specialized domains
- **Maintainability** through coordinated swarm patterns  
- **Optimal Performance** via cross-domain intelligence sharing
- **Democratic Decision Making** through swarm consensus protocols
- **Continuous Learning** across the entire hive ecosystem
- **Strategic Alignment** between technical implementation and business objectives

**TreeAI represents the cutting edge of multi-agent AI coordination, combining forestry business intelligence with advanced swarm patterns to create an ecosystem where individual agents collaborate democratically to achieve superior outcomes across all domains.**
