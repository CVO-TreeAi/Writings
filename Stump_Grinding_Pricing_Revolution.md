# The Real Math Behind Stump Grinding: Why "Price Per Inch" Doesn't Work

## The Industry's Dirty Little Secret

Every stump grinding company quotes the same way: "$X per inch of diameter."

It's been the industry standard for decades. It's simple. It's familiar. And it's completely wrong.

Here's why: A 30-inch stump that's cut flush to the ground is a completely different animal than a 30-inch stump standing 4 feet tall. One takes an hour. The other takes all day. Yet traditional pricing treats them identically.

"But obviously I would charge more if its 4 ft high."

Why is that subjective variable supposed to dictate price? Why cant it be exact? Sure a 4 ft difference is easy to think about, but whats the price difference if you are grinding an 8 inch high stump 10 inches deep or a 4 inch high stump 6 inches deep? The first stump is 18 inches of grinding. Up and down, side to side. The second stump is only 10 inches. Both have the same 20 inch diameter up top. Which one is going to cause more wear and tear?
Which one will be faster?
Which one will cost more to complete?

So if we can identify that then we can identify the specific pricing needed using TreeShop's volumetric pricing.

The stump grinding industry has been lying to itself—and to customers (unintentionally)—by pretending that diameter alone determines the work involved. It doesn't. Not even close. Now that I pointed it out, you cant unsee it. You're Welcome. Lets Get to WORK!

## The Three Dimensions That Actually Matter

Stump grinding is three-dimensional work. You're not removing a circle—you're grinding a cylinder. And just like calculating the volume of a cylinder requires height and depth, not just radius, pricing stump grinding requires understanding all three critical dimensions:

### Height Above Grade: The Visible Challenge

This is what's left standing after the tree comes down. Sometimes it's a flush cut at ground level. Sometimes it's a 5-foot monument because the removal crew couldn't get their saw any lower for always undetermined reasons lol.

Anyways, the stump needs ground...

Every inch of height is more material to grind. More time. More wear on equipment. More chips to handle. Yet traditional pricing ignores this completely.

Think about it: Would you charge the same to demolish a one-story house as a three-story house with the same footprint? Of course not. So why do we pretend stumps are different?

### Depth of Grind

Here's where customer expectations create exponential complexity. "Just grind it down" means different things to different people:

- **6 inches below grade**: Basic removal, grass will grow over it
- **8-10 inches below grade**: Standard for lawn restoration
- **12-14 inches below grade**: Deep enough to plant a new tree
- **18+ inches below grade**: Construction or hardscaping prep

Each inch deeper isn't just "a little more work"—it's exponentially more material as the root flare expands underground. To professionals, the thought of not grinding the stump to completion is ludicrous. But, it is not unheard of for some companies even to just surface grind the stump, like a mulcher sorta. The problem with surface grinds is the stump effect is still there.

### Diameter: Yes, It Still Matters (But Differently)

This is where each company will start to differ on their procedure. The end product remains the same, we simply need to define what a stump is. How much 'trunk' needs to be on top of the stump still before you will break out the saw. If it has 1 inch of height you would just grind, and if it had 8 ft you would cut first. There are so many variables here that it doesn't really matter. JUST DEFINE YOUR COMPANY STUMP. TreeShop apps will default to 6 inches and under. SO, why this matters. We measure 6 inches off the ground for our diameter when possible. If a DBH tape is used and not a tape measure to collect, the system is still accurate enough, just still cut it lol.

But here's the key: diameter only matters in relation to the other dimensions. A 40-inch diameter stump that's flush-cut and needs 4-inch grinding would be easier than a 20-inch stump that's 3 feet tall requiring 12-inch depth.

## The Fourth Dimension: Site Reality

OK so we got our three dimensions figured out. Height, depth, diameter. Math class is over, right?

Not quite. WHERE is this stump? Whats around it? Whats under it? 

Because that 30-inch stump in your wide open back yard is a whole different beast than the same stump wedged between your AC unit and the pool equipment. One gets the big machine. The other gets a waiver... lol Im kidding, but it should reflect in the price regardles.

Site factors change everything. Can I get a machine there? Is it next to a gas line? Is the ground soggy from last night's rain? Is there a 30-inch gate that my 31-inch machine won't fit through? (Yes, this happens more than you'd think.)

These aren't minor details. They determine:
- Which equipment I can use
- How long it's actually going to take
- What safety measures are required
- Whether I need to call 811 for markouts

Every stump exists somewhere, and that somewhere matters just as much as the stump itself. Neitche- maybe lol. 

## Real-World Examples: Same Diameter, Different Jobs

Three stumps. All 24 inches in diameter. Check out the difference:

**Stump #1: The Easy Money**
- Cut flush to ground
- 6-inch grind
- Open yard
- No obstacles
- **Done in 45 minutes**

**Stump #2: The Typical Tuesday**
- 18 inches tall
- 10-inch deep grind
- Through a 36-inch gate
- Irrigation lines everywhere
- **2.5 hours of work**

**Stump #3: The "Why Did I Take This Job"**
- 3 feet tall (storm damage)
- 14-inch depth request
- Zero machine access
- Surrounded by utilities
- **6 hours with hand equipment**

Same 24-inch measurement. Totally different amount of work. If you're charging by diameter alone, you're either losing money or ripping someone off. There's no middle ground.

## The Equipment Game

Once you know what you're actually dealing with, you can bring the right tool:

**Small Units (25-35 HP)**: Fits through gates, good for small jobs. But don't bring this to a big stump fight.

**Mid-Size Machines (50-75 HP)**: The daily drivers. These handle most residential work without breaking a sweat.

**The Big Guns (75-100+ HP)**: When you need to delete stumps fast. Just make sure you can get them there.

Sometimes that "simple" stump becomes a small grinding marathon because your machine won't fit. That's info you need BEFORE you quote the job.

## Why This Actually Matters

### For Property Owners

You get real quotes based on real work. No more:
- Surprise fees when things get "complicated"
- Overpaying for easy stumps
- Contractors bailing on underpriced jobs

Instead:
- Compare quotes that actually mean something
- Adjust the work to fit your budget
- Know what you're paying for

### For Contractors

Stop gambling on every job:
- Price it right the first time
- Bring the right equipment
- Schedule accurately
- Make money consistently

No more losing your shirt on "simple" stumps that turn into all-day projects.

### For Everyone

When we all measure the same way, everyone wins. Clear communication, fair pricing, professional service.

## The Tech That Makes It Work

We're not using clipboards and guesswork anymore:

- **Digital measurements**: Capture exact dimensions with your phone
- **Photo documentation**: Show customers exactly what they're getting
- **Production tracking**: Know how long jobs really take
- **Smart scheduling**: Route multiple stumps efficiently

The same tech that changed construction estimating is here for stump grinding. About time.

## The Stuff Nobody Talks About

**Treated Wood**: Railroad ties, old fence posts, chemical-treated lumber—you need to know BEFORE you grind. Those chips can't just go anywhere.

**Disease Control**: Some stumps carry diseases that spread through equipment. Know when to sanitize between jobs.

**Chip Quality**: Clean chips are valuable mulch. Contaminated chips are disposal headaches. The assessment tells you which you're making.

## The Future of Professional Stump Grinding

The stump grinding industry stands at a crossroads. One path continues down the worn trail of diameter-only pricing—a system that fails contractors and customers alike. The other path embraces comprehensive volumetric assessment that captures the true scope of work through height above grade, depth of grind, diameter at ground level, and critical site factors.

This isn't theoretical. Companies implementing volumetric stump assessment are already seeing the results: more accurate quotes, better equipment utilization, improved customer satisfaction, and most importantly—predictable profitability. When you measure what actually matters, you can price what you're actually doing.

The mathematics are straightforward. Height times depth times diameter gives you volume. Site factors provide the multiplier. Together, they create a pricing framework that's both fair and profitable. No more gambling on every job. No more awkward conversations about "unexpected complications." Just honest, transparent pricing based on measurable work.

## The Industry Transformation Ahead

As property owners become more sophisticated and contractors seek competitive advantages, those still clinging to oversimplified pricing models will find themselves increasingly marginalized. The market demands transparency, accuracy, and professionalism—qualities that volumetric assessment delivers in abundance.

The technology exists. The methodology is proven. The only question remaining is how quickly individual contractors will adapt to this new reality. Those who embrace comprehensive assessment today will define the industry standards of tomorrow. Those who resist will find themselves explaining why their "simple" pricing keeps missing the mark.

Stump grinding may seem like straightforward work, but as we've demonstrated, the variables that determine actual effort are anything but simple. By acknowledging this complexity and building systems to capture it accurately, we elevate the entire profession from guesswork to precision.

The choice is clear: Continue pretending all stumps are created equal, or embrace a system that measures—and prices—the work that actually needs to be done. The industry is moving forward. The question is whether you'll lead, follow, or be left behind.
